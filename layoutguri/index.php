<ul>
<li>We fixed an issue that announced the mini world change "Bank 
Robbery" with the same message as "Stampede" on the world board in the 
Adventurers' Guild.</li>
<li>We addressed a small issue with Lurik so that players are no longer 
stuck in the mission "The Island of Dragons" of the Explorer Society 
quest if they lost the scale from a frozen dragon.</li>
<li>The witches' grimoire can now be bought from Black Bert if you 
opened the chest in the mission "Eclipse" of the Inquisition quest.</li>
<li>A death in PvP through friendly fire is now correctly counted as PvP death so that a Twist of Fate blessing can take effect.</li>
<li>Levitating on magic walls and wild growth now results in the same 
effects as if a player had walked into them. Please note that the 
effects depend on the PvP mode setting of the player who placed the 
obstacle.</li>

<b>Lieutenant:</b> "Commander, the situation is still under control, but
 the enemies are strong and it seems that their number is endless, as if
 any bad dream that was ever dreamed has come to life on this accursed 
island. We sustain heavy casualties and need more troops."

<br><br>

<b>Sandomo:</b> "A messenger is already on the way to Lord Henricus to request reinforcements. What about the bridge?"

<b>Lieutenant:</b> "While the bridge is safe, the area itself is still 
full of threats, though. At least, our men have already named the 
abominations they have to face every night and day. Frazzlemaws and 
guzzlemaws are almost everywhere and try to devour anything that gets in
 their way. Their big sharp teeth cut through our armors as if they are 
made out of cheese, and they are as fast as the wind. Furthermore, we 
found some evidence that there exists an even bigger one of them. The 
traces lead to a cave, but we are waiting for your command to break in."

<br><br>

<b>Sandomo:</b> "Mh. Not yet. We will wait for the reinforcements. If 
that cave is really the residence of some kind of leader I do not want 
to risk the life of more men. Do we still bring in adequate supplies of 
materials for the bridge?"

<br><br>
<b>Lieutenant:</b> "Well, Commander, we are missing several warriors 
which were supposed to collect more materials in the caves around. 
According to what I am told by the soldiers, strange things are 
happening there. They saw how their comrades entered the caves but they 
never returned, even though there were no signs of hostile activity. 
However, I have some good news as well. I sent a patrol to search for 
the missing men. Neither hide nor hair of them was found, but the men 
were able to tame some of the creatures that are roaming around the 
caves. So, now we have a cavalry. We have still a hard time to keep 
those silencer beasts and shock heads at bay, though."

<br><br>

<b>Sandomo:</b> "Well done, Lieutenant. I want you to send another 
patrol to investigate those caves. We have to know what is going on 
there. Any news about the wall?"

<br><br>

<b>Lieutenant:</b> "Yes Commander. We were able to breach it. We 
encountered massive resistance but we could break the enemy's lines and 
our troops are now exploring the area behind. Right now, I am waiting 
for news from the front line. Our messenger will be here at any moment. 
Ah. There he comes!"

<br><br>

<b>Messenger:</b> "Mylord Commander, Lieutenant, please excuse my behaviour. The terror I have seen is just too dreadful. <br>
Once we passed the wall, we came upon an old ruined town. It all looked 
so strange and surreal. Imminent danger was in the wind. Nevertheless, 
we had the order to explore the area and so we did. We found an entry to
 the deeper levels of the city. Partially, it looks like an abandoned 
prison. Half of us entered the basement while the other half started to 
scout the area around. 

<br>

Then, all of a sudden… All hell was let loose. They came from all over! 
Indescribable creatures started to slay us. Incredibly strong, fast, and
 ruthless, they killed a lot of us before we were able to defend 
ourselves. We fled into the ruins and our first attempt was to reach the
 other soldiers downstairs. Darkness awaited us there. While we were 
trying to organise ourselves, we heard the cries of our friends… their 
death cries. None of them will ever see the light again. We decided to 
go back to the surface and tried to find a way back to the wall and the 
bridge. Somehow, we made it out of the ruins. We were close to the wall 
when an evil and horrible voice split the air. 
<br><br>
<b>"How dare you to come to this place! You puny humans will be my snacks! NO ONE WILL ESCAPE ME!"</b>
<br><br>
We looked back and what we saw, paralysed us. I cannot recite what 
happened then, Commander, but I am sure that I am the only one who 
survived."

<b>Sandomo:</b> "Praise the gods that at least you made it. Enough talk!

your orders, now go!"

stranglehold. Yet, the Inquisition WILL win this land back from the

Henricus, Lord Inquisitor<br>
Harbour Street<br>

<i> Mylord Henricus, <br><br>

Your vision was right. The darkest nightmare came true! We found the 
island of your dreams east of Darashia. After we anchored we went on 
shore to explore it. The attacks started instantly as we set foot on the
 ground. Due to the explicit warning of his Lordship, we were prepared. 
We managed to drive back the first wave of these unholy creatures. 
Immediately, we began to make our camp and to organise our defense. A 
few skirmishes followed but after some hours all creatures were either 
dead or fled. <br><br>

The camp seems to be safe, for now. It is surrounded by water and rocks 
that should provide an adequate protection against the evil breed.

<br><br>
Without the intensive warnings of his Lordship, the blessing of the 
churches, and our experience, I am sure that none of us would be alive 
anymore. 

After we managed to fight off these first attacks, we carefully started 
exploring our surroundings. Many of my men have died while trying to map
 the isle. We fought against creatures that I have neither seen before 
nor did I believe that they would exist, not even in my darkest dreams. 
Their existence is nothing but pure blasphemy against the good gods. 

<br><br>
<center><img src="index_pliki/roschamuul_damagedbridge02.jpg" height="352" width="480"></center>
<br>
So far, we have been able to repulse the enemy over and over again and 
to broaden our territory. However, we encountered a problem: A big river
 divides the landmass into two parts and the only way across is an old 
bridge. Unfortunately, the bridge was destroyed and needs to be 
repaired. Our excursion is not prepared to fulfill such a endeavour, 
though. We know how to rebuild it to ensure a permanent passage, but we 
lack the materials. It seems that we can find the required resources 
here but due to the immense menace and the continuing attacks I cannot 
spare one single man to look for the necessary construction materials. I
 need all my men to keep the monsters at bay.

<br><br>

<img src="index_pliki/outfit_dreamwarden_small.jpg" style="cursor: pointer;" onClick="window.open('http://static.tibia.com/images/news/outfit_dreamwarden.jpg', 'dreamwarden', 'width=568, height=692')" align="right" height="305" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="250">

Furthermore, we spotted an enormous wall in the distance on the other 
side of the river. Once we succeed in crossing the bridge, we will have 
to breach this monument. As things currently look, I expect more heavy 
resistance. Most likely, we can only reach the area behind the wall at 
great cost of life. Only the gods know what kind of challenges and 
diabolic beasts will await us there. I have the feeling that pure evil 
is waiting there to be unleashed. I expect the worst. 

<br><br>
Therefore, I kindly request more troops. However, I highly recommend his
 Lordship to send only elite units. We need fearless fighters and only 
the best will have a chance to survive here. We do not have any use for 
warriors that lay down their arms at the first sign of a deadly threat. 
There are only two options to leave this island once you are here: In 
victory or death!
<br><br>
Waiting for the response of his Lordship.<br><br>

Sincerly, <br>
Sandomo</i></td>

I am caught, a prisoner of my own imagination! My darkest fears became 
reality. Deformed creatures that should not exist, are stalking me. 
Driven by a never-ending hunger and wickedness! My heart is filled with 
panic and dismay. I can feel their icy and rotten breath. I can hear 
their evil laughter. Their sharp teeth and claws are waiting to taste 
living flesh, my flesh! The gates between reality and dream were opened,
 and living nightmares were unleashed on this place. Horror and agony 
are ruling this land.

<br><br>

Darkness is imprisoning me. Nothing seems to be real anymore. Please 
tell me that I'm dreaming! Oh please, wake me! All my experience, all my
 strength, all my courage, worth nothing! My sword, my magic, useless 
against these horrible demons. I fought in a hundred battles, I 
challenged death and survived... but this fight I cannot win… This is my
 own living hell…

No salvation, no hope! I am lost… and cannot flee… wake me! <b>WAKE ME!</b>
